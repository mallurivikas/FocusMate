Repository of Team Connect's project for AI Hackdays 2025

## Project Overview
We propose an AI-powered solution that allows students to solve doubts in real-time without needing a phone or screen. By integrating speech-to-text and natural language processing (NLP) technologies, students can ask questions verbally, and the AI will respond with answers. This reduces distractions and promotes healthier study habits by minimizing screen time.

This project was developed as part of AI Hackdays 2025 and is a hardware-based project that uses ESP32. The project doesn't involve a traditional website, but it features a server running on the ESP32, which can be accessed locally through a web interface. However, it's important to note:

To access the server, you need to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the ESP32 device running the code.

### What's Included
Source Code: The main program that runs on the ESP32, including the server setup.

Images: Pictures of the hardware setup and screenshots of the server interface.

Videos: Demonstrations of the hardware project and the server in action.

Presentation (PPT): A comprehensive presentation describing the project in detail, including the problem statement, domain, and key features.

### Instructions
Images: Check the images folder for visuals of the hardware setup and server interface.

Videos: Refer to the videos folder for a working demo of the project.

Server Access: The server code can be run locally on the ESP32. Ensure your device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network to access the server.

Presentation (PPT): Review the presentation file for an in-depth explanation of the problem statement, domain, and key features of the project.
